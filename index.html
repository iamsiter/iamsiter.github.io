                                <p>The OmniDocs Enterprise Content Management Software (ECM) is the market leading solution to enable “digital transformation of your enterprise”. It allows the end-to-end management of enterprise content right from capture to disposition. It delivers contextual information to business stakeholders for improved collaboration, smarter decision making and enhanced customer satisfaction.</p>
                                <p>At Newgen I was responsible for implementation of quality products like OmniDocs, OmniScan, OmniFlow, BRMS (rule management), BAM (reporting tool), MDM (data management tool) etc.
                                 These involve customization of tools at various levels (ranging from UI at front end to thread running at core).Our client banks IN MEA-NIC Bank (Kenya),Dubai Financial Market (UAE),Abu Dhabhi Commercial Bank (Dubai) came up with new processes which were developed and deployed.Custom utilities made were developed as per the requirements of the client.</p>
                                <p>Offline Account opening for NIC Bank, Kenya where start to end solution was provided to the bank.
                                Web service integration with IPRS, Blacklist check, T24, CRB system were key integrations made. An application was generated which was then introduced into our systems and integrated with core banking  products at Newgen Softwares .
                                This business process gave a solution for opening accounts and automatically completing the manual processes of KYC, background checks by delegating to to concerned organizations.</p>

                                <h4>Internship @ ISRO</h4>
                                <hr class="star-primary">
                                The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of the Government of Republic of India headquartered in the city of Bengaluru.
                                I worked at Space Application Center(SAC), a division of ISRO located at Ahemadabad, Gujarat which carries out all the operations on data collected from satellites.
                                I worked under the guidance of Ankur Garg(Scientist Engineer-SC) and assisted him for his on-going projects.As a research assistant I was responsible for working on satellite image data collected over time from Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) in Indian Remote Sensing Satellites(IRS).Advanced techniques of image processing were used to extract the data related to land terrain.I developed software tools which were used to operate the equipments.These tools were developed in Python,C++,Vector Graphics. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                At SAC ,my contribution was in compiling the <a href="http://www.sac.gov.in/SACSITE/Desertification_Atlas_2016_SAC_ISRO.pdf">Annual Atlas for Land Desertification/Degradation Status.</a>
                                The problem statement was to process tha images collected from satellites over past 2-3 years and segregate the images for each state(a sample image can be seen below).
                                Below steps were taken to get a final data which could be then used by farmers,city planners,forest and municipal authorities.

                                <p>The data extracted was cleaned for analysis and validated against the ground data that was collected from surveys and tests conducted by various departments.
                                The end result was used to compile Atlas for Land Degradation/Desertification  which was published in year 2016.<br/>

                                <p>
                                The work demanded deep understanding of image processing concepts and perfection for handling the equipments for generating the data.It was a good learning experience and demanded patience and determination.

                                <hr class="star-primary">
                                <img src="img/portfolio/icare1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                                <div class="mytext">
                                    <p>This is one of my self projects which I started just as a hobby in my junior year. The main idea was to provide medical information and knowledge in hour of need to people living in rural areas or in any situation where immediate medical attention is required but not available. I built the first version in my fall'11 semester, later I decided to take it to the next level by integrating voice based search, hardware testing and diagnostic equipment thereby making it a complete doctor in a box solution.</p>
                                    <p>I submitted this project in <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/">Microsoft Imagine Cup</a> 2011 in Software Category. The project was highly appreciated by the judges and our team was national pre finalst for that year, but the organizers thought that putting up a system like we were proposing is a mammoth task and can't be completed in short competition deadline. Thus our team was rejected from the competition</p>
                                    <p>It was one of my genuine ideas so I kept researching on it as a side project, I even learned haematology and other diagnostic testing procedures to think out of new ways to integrate with my system . </p>
                                    <p>I kept on tinkering with the design and implementation on my own. Recently, I was trying to implement the IBM Watson API in the application as they made it open for third party applications. I think that watson api will be a good add on for this project. I am also researching on sensors and different diagnostic test mechanisms to make the iCare capable of testing and diagnosing a wide variety of ailments and diseases.</p>
                                    <p>Here is some information and a few screenshots of first version of the application that I developed in my junior year. The application included symptom matcher, nearest hospital finder, medical history profile and drug information as the main features</p>
                                    <p>
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                    <p>Every year millions of people die each year due to the lack of improper medical attention or due to late detection of diseases and also stats shows that more than 225,000 people die each year due to improper medical treatment or advice. And nearlymany hundred thousand others due to lack of proper SOS help. My solution aims at lowering these numbers and providing better healthcare for people around the world . </p>
                                    <p>This is a desktop app (iCare) which which essentially provides you the functionality of doctor in a box. It provides you valueable healthcare information when needed. Just Imagine its 2 AM in the morning and you got a sudden headache or you are some place remote and you are on your own or there is something wrong with your body but you don't know whether it is serious enough to see a doctor or not , ICare helps you answer these questions and get useful information in the hour of need .</p>
                                    <h2>Key Features  </h2>

                                    <p>This project was made initially as a competition entry for Appcelerator Devchallenge named as Electroapp. The first version had very basic functionality as it was hacked together in a week from idea to prototype in a dorm room. It enables users to control home appliances and devices using their smartphones.</p>
                                    <p>When I researched the market I found out that there were no similar products in the market except Nest thermostat controller. I decided to research on it, improve it and finally launch it as a polished product. I started working on it, I integrated cctv feeds, lock controls and machine learning in the initial version.</p>
                                    <p>I also implemented XBee wireless communication within the buttons/sockets and local control unit (a tablet), which in turn connected to the remote server via wifi. I also applied a bit of machine learning in the system to learn user behaviour, preferences and act accordingly. </p>
                                    <p>By the time the project was almost complete and just final touches were remaning, a new similar product launched in the market by Belkin company named "Wemo". So, we decided not to launch it as a professional project.</p>

                                    <p>A mobile application called <b>'Nostalgia'</b>, which automatically generates a travel journal based on your travel, getting contents from various feeds (mobile gallery, tweets, Facebook posts etc), and analyzes that data (Natural Language Processing for tweets and posts, image based mood recognition for images) and to produce a blog like summary of your trip in a very nice interface. The idea was actually given by one of the members of our technical club which sounded very promising. We brainstormed various ideas and decided to work on my suggested concept of a travel diary generator, Nostalgia. </p>

                                    The main idea behind the app is to allow users a better avenue to revisit their memories. Application requires negligible user input to produce a journal based out of journey.At the start of a trip user press record and at the end of the trip stop recording. It fetches local and remote user content (photos, videos, social feeds/comments) analyze this data to generate a travel journal. The images are analysed for emotions and moods using image processing, social feeds from networks like Facebook, Twitter , G+ are analysed using NLP and then all this information is used to generate the travel journal in a very nice UI also end video.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>The present project uses a couple of pre-set templates do changes in them depending on the analysis of user content. We am trying to achieve more dynamic and detailed content generation in future versions of the app. The idea was to generate a blog with minimum investment to time.This blog can be shared with a wannabe traveller who can get information about itinerary,hotels,places to visit etc all at one place. This idea was presented to many travel companies like Travel Triangle, Make My Trip which could use these blogs to attract customers and offer suitable packages.

                                OmniScan is a core scanning and OCR'ing product at Newgen Softwares.It is used in most of the bank in India(ICICI Bank,Yes Bank) and across the world.
                                It is used for CTS(Cheque Truncation System) where cheques from different banks are scanned automatically and stored in Document Management System.Various parts of information live MICR code,signature and extracted and verified against user database.
                                The purpose of developing OmniScanTM is to automate the process of scanning documents and segregating them into records and associating tags with the documents so as to enable easy searching and retrieval of the documents in the desired Document Management System (DMS) to which they are exported. It also caters to the need of
                                creating folders in the DMS based on desired field values. Prescanned documents can also be imported into OmniScanTM to arrange them into records. Extraction of values from the scanned documents is also supported for BARCODE, OCR, and MICR.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                As a member of the scanning team, I was responsible for developign the user interface for conversion of jpg/png images to image type PDF documents which were then comverted into native format for easy storage of the document.
                                I developed the OCR'ing backend and integrated with Sakhr OCR engine which was done to cater for needs of bank which worked in Arabic language.
                                The challenge was to OCR the Arabic text written in left to right direction store the results so that documents can be searched on the basis of text which means facility for Full Text Search</p>
                                <p>
                                The FTS was acheived by storing the coordinated of the extracted text and storing it in the database.Whenever the user queried for some piece of text search was conducted in database and document was selected and using the coordinates text was highlighted in yellow color.

                                Geotagging (also written as GeoTagging) is the process of adding geographical identification metadata to various media such as a geotagged photograph or video, websites, SMS messages, QR Codes[1] or RSS feeds and is a form of geospatial metadata. This data usually consists of latitude and longitude coordinates, though they can also include altitude, bearing, distance, accuracy data, and place names, and perhaps a time stamp.

                                based on user’s location(latitude & longitude) and conducting online surveys and polls.Images were collected from various sources and were geotagged by collecting user location of by asking users to add location manually.Images were then compressed usign advanced compression techniques and stored in the database which was indexed.
                                Based on user's location suggestions for places nearby like hotels, lakes, restaurants,hospitals were shown.A poll or survey could also be created if someone wants to get reviews on their places.
                                It was integrated with SMS gateway in which user can subscribe to messaging service and get updates whenever user is nearby and offers and discounts are available for the user.

				Inspired by the functioning of IEEE , I planned to start a club which has sole aim of knowldge sharing where seniors and juniors engage with each other and develop some fresh ideas.I was focussed to build task force which could take part in various cometitions during college festivals as well as online hackathons.</p>

				<p>I became a Microsoft Student Partner(MSP) and brought the students in contact with events like Dreamspark Yatra ,CodeFests and Imagine Cup.This attracted many juniors and helped me to make them realize that our college lacked a tech club.
				As an MSP, I took part in monthly editions of DreamSpark Yatra and developed apps for Windows Phone 7.One of my app Crazy Fingers was declared as best app and was given a Pro-badge on their app store.
				I motivated students to take part in Imagine Cup which was an international competition and brought the ideas into implementation if the  idea is selected by the judges.I took part in Imagine Cup 2012 edition and was selected at national level</p>
				<p>By this time,I had got enough resources to launch the college tech club.Tech-Radar was finally started where student could engage in open disussions about latest technologies and platforms.There were sessios and webinars conducted by every member on any tech concept thay have learnt.
				Besides that we prepared and funded projects which could be presented at hackathons and leading online competitions.The tech group is still functional in the college and I am still in constant touch with the club members.

                                <p>From II'nd year of my college I started working on freelance projects and startup tech support/consultation to hone my skills with practical implementations. I developed more than 50 projects for different individuals and clients. </p>
                                <p>Bluegape - an online merchandising store, was a startup back then. I got a call from the founder to help with the setting up of an ecommerce website and payment integration. They were under a tight schedule as they just got an order form a big local brand. </p>
                                <p>I setup their first online merchandise store for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/garbagebin?fref=ts">Garbage bin's</a> first comics, with payment integration. One of their team member was working on the implementation with me. </p>
                                <p>The first auction was a success they got 100,000+ orders, we managed to keep the system online as long as we could but finally the server crashed due to bandwidth limitations and excess hits.</p>
                                <p>It was a very good experience and I got good learning on how to build and manage an online ecommerce store. Later on, they expanded and became a 40 member team, raised funding and added different merchandise to their store. Until recently, they ran into copyright issues and have to <a href="http://www.nextbigwhat.com/bluegape-shutdown-297/">shut down</a> their online fan art store. </p>

                                    Biodiesel & non conservational sources of energy : I made this project in my school for science fair, It included use of transesterification process to produce high quality bio-diesel and some of new ideas for production of energy like tidal dams, solar power plants and a concept for harnessing power of lightning. The project was highly appreciated by the judges and I won at state level and got selected for national level science fair. </br>

But, a problem arose when doctors refused to use an app for writing prescription. Then I have to completely re-write a new app from scratch, this version allowed users to send the prescription to YoPharma instead of doctor's directly sending it. After that, chemists will read the prescription and medicines will be delivered to the patient. Moreover, the user will also get notifications of when to take a pill. </br>
